## Problem Statement
Currently there is no such application which allows Howard students to have others do some of their work (for instance: laundry, getting their grocery etc). So we realized that we could make an ios app where students can collaborate with each other and have their tasks done in exchange of money. 

## Users
Our users include Howard students who live on campus and they will use the app for getting their tasks done.

## Technical Details
• The application will implement table view to show lists of task that is available and some willing person will choose to do that task.<br />
• The cell in the table view will have button to chat to the poster of that task. <br />
• For now we are planning to use camera to post image that corresponds to the task (for eg: bag of laundry) but this is optional too.<br />
• We will be using Parse for backend.
